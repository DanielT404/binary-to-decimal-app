          <p className="Binary__Card--content">In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, 
          which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).
          The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit. Because of its straightforward implementation in 
          digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.</p>
